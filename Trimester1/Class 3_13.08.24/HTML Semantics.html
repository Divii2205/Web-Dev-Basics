        Husky is a general term for a dog used in the polar regions, primarily
        and specifically for work as sled dogs. It refers to a traditional
        northern type, notable for its cold-weather tolerance and overall
        hardiness. Modern racing huskies that maintain arctic breed traits (also
        known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the
        fastest dogs.

        Huskies have continued to be used in sled-dog racing, as well as
        expedition and trek style tour businesses, and as a means of essential
        transportation in rural communities. Huskies are also kept as pets, and
        groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and
        adventure-trekking dogs.

        The term "husky" first came into usage in the mid to late 1700s. At this
        time, "Esquimaux" or "Eskimo" was a common term for pre-Columbian Arctic
        inhabitants of North America. Several dialectal permutations were in use
        including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus, dogs used by Arctic people
        were the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie's dogs, and eventually simply
        the husky dogs. Canadian and American settlers, not well versed on
        Russian geography, would later extend the word to Chukotka sled dogs
        imported from Russia, thus giving rise to the term Siberian husky.
