# target:
intiial element where the event is triggered is known as the targer elememt.

# Reference
https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing 

**Bubbling**: When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

# **!! Event propagation**: cycle of *bubbling* and *capturing*/*trickling* #

# !! note the order:
capturing -> target -> bubbling

!! eventListener is a heavy method !!
